This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#installation) and Python3 on the backend.

This project uses the [recipe-scrapers tool](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers).

## Set Up RecipeDex
You can try out RecipeDex at recipedex.net from 10am - 6pm while servers are running.

OR 

You can find the backend code for RecipeDex [here](https://github.com/kwonj1234/recipedex_backend). Run the following lines of code to start up a Flask server locally and use recipedex.net that way.

    git clone https://github.com/kwonj1234/recipedex_backend.git &&
    cd recipedex_backend &&
    python3 run.py

OR

If you want to run everything locally.

Install RecipeDex using

    git clone https://github.com/kwonj1234/recipedex_backend.git &&   
    git clone https://github.com/kwonj1234/recipedex_frontend.git &&   
    cd recipedex_frontend && npm install

## Running locally
From the directory you cloned the two repositories, start the Flask server.

    cd recipedex_backend &&   
    python3 run.py

In a separate terminal, return to the directory you cloned the two repositories and start up the application in development mode.
 
    npm start
